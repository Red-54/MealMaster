This application was created to explore the capabilities of AI in the culinary world. We use Google's Gemini Pro language model to understand your needs and provide accurate recipe suggestions. We're continuously working to improve our algorithms and provide the best meal planning experience! 

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Tell us what you like:**  Head to the "Preferences" page to set your dietary preferences (like cuisine types) and any allergies you have.
2. **Show us what you've got:** On the "Suggestions" page, you can optionally upload an image of the ingredients you have on hand.
3. **Let the AI do the rest:**  Click "Recommend," and Meal Master will generate a personalized recipe idea just for you!  

We're excited to bring the magic of AI to your kitchen! ✨''')
